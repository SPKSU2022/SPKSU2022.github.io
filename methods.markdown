## Methods
CompChores determined that the Web Application would act as a medium for essentially communicating with the adaptive database. Dart and Flutter would be utilized in constructing the interface portion of the application and by means of the Dart Materials library would construct containers for which the user would delegate prompts sent to the Database. CompChores would limit the users to only what prompts were provided as opposed to unrestrained freedom as the inherent risk to operations was too great when permitting communications to the Amazon Web Services.
For the chosen services, the vast array of potential services provided meant that the development team had to be reserved in selecting practical modules. Services were chosen on the merits that they could improve both the efficacy of the app’s entirety as well as the users’ experience with the application. With the semester long time restraint, this meant that the services chosen had to have prior, helpful documentation which could be adapted and understood within an appropriate time as to not halt development time.
