## Source Control

As for source control, the CompChores development team resigned to GitHub to manage progress. Due to the small size of the development team, there was less concern for accidental concurrency on the same packages that could impact progress. If either member were to work on the repository, team members were able to notify the other by means of text, discord, or any other IM mediums. Regardless, CompChores still retained the previously established GANTT charts to the best of the teamâ€™s ability and any modifications to the original schedule was discussed in person during the in-person meetings. Development remained relatively stable, in that future scheduling was reactive to the agreed progress being made up to each meeting. Constant pro-active discussions between intent and results made sure that each updated version was understood between the team members, keeping source control just as stable with little to no retractions to progress.
To ensure that translations of newer or updated packages, it was vital that the changes were conducted in isolated environments that simulated in practice and in implementation. That way, changes to be carried out were vetted to ensure risk aversion and as smooth translation to the next phase. Regardless of understood and agreed following changes, it was vital to ensure that some level of documentation was present at each stage. This came beneficial during Amplify which, being a recent development of AWS, was turbulent to changes and allowed team members to understand how each alteration was necessary.
