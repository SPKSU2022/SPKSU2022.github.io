## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project proved to be a fantastic challenge while also a creative learning situation. Amongst our team we learned many of the skills it takes to start a project from the ground up, plan the roadmap for the future of the project, communication, source control, and working with requirements for a project. This project has challenged the skills we have learned through our journey of Computer Science at KSU while still giving us the freedom to make the project ours. We are grateful for the opportunity to work on a project of this nature and with people we may have not otherwise worked with. This project has been a great learning lesson and opportunity to show what we have learned throughout our time at KSU, we hope you feel the same!
