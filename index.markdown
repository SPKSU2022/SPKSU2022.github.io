## Abstract
Getting anyone motivated to complete chores can be a chore itself! To solve this issue, our team is using Dart and Flutter to build a desktop application that pits roommates, family members, and siblings against one another to complete chores for points. The purpose of this program is to simulate competition between users in order to motivate users to complete tasks amongst the living space.
To complete this task, our program will provide a place where users can create a family, create an account, join a family, create chores, complete chores, check chore history, view the family scoreboard, and view how many chores they have completed. Users will be able to change chore points based on difficulty, estimated time of completion, and priority. There will also be a way for users to check chore history in order to know which chores were completed by each person. The family will have a main homepage which will show the top three scores within the family, the chores with the highest priority, and the family ID in which users can share with one another to allow others to join the family.
